    This is the home page for me, Lars Erik Schonander. My main interests data analysis and visualization, geospatial analysis, economic development, and bringing tech into international affairs.

    I currently work at Lincoln Network, a think-tank as a software engineer. There  I help non-profits
    across D.C. and beyond with their various tech problems, from web development to data analysis.

<p>I write for various outlets and blog as well. Below are links to recent articles in both catagories:</p>

            For Lincoln Network, a think-tank, I do data-driven research along with general explainers on various technology issues. Here I wrote a explainer on the data labeling industry,
            which helps label the data that tech companies collect so that companies like Waymo or Tesla can have their driverless cars working properly.

            The Aggregate is a [bi]weekly newsletter I run on the analysis of interesting datasets. For this edition, I was working on a personal project to get better at natural language
            processing. To do this, I discovered BuzzFeed News had a paginated non-rate limited API, so I designed a scraper for the API to get 49,050 articles, or back to 2014. To then understand
            the types of articles BuzzFeed News publishes, I did topic modeling via word embeddings to analyze the dataset.

            Back in late 2019, I discovered that Snapchat published their political ad spend library. For MediaFile, I decided to do an analysis of the dataset, and discovered that Snapchat was used for politics outside of the 
            United States. For example, the APK (the party Erdogan leads) political party advertised itself with Snapchat adds, and the UAE used Snapchat to advertise for their elections.

            In 2019, there have been quite a few journalism lay offs. Via web scraping, I turned a textual listing o the layoffs by month from January to May 2019. This was used to provide
            context to one of the troubling issues where national reporters have to do the work that local reporters used to do, because of how gutted local news organizations have become.
