            <h1>A Little Madness in Madrid</h1>

        <p>I am currently doing a fall study abroad in Madrid, and it is a great experience so far, however something has troubled me a little bit. That being, political stickers and posters out of all things.</p>
<p>Something I like to do while walking sometimes is take a look at various stickers people put up. Most of the time they are perfectly normal, but sometimes they are not. Sometimes you end up finding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Hermann_Hoppe">Hans Hermann Hoppe</a> Pepe out of all things in the middle of DuPont Circle. That is when you question the politics of many people.</p>
<p>In Madrid, I have not seen many Pepes running around, but the political stickers and posters have been rather concerning. While walking down Paseo de la Castellana one day, I saw several pro-Franco and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FET_y_de_las_JONS">Falange</a> stickers around. It was rather strange to realize that,</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Someone took the time in the middle of the night to put these up.</li>
<li>B: That their still actual Franco supporters in the 21st century running around.</li>
</ul>
<p>More concerning were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sun">Black Sun</a> stickers I saw in a couple of places. It seems unlike in the United States the far-right in Europe are more public about their views, which makes sense when you read any newspaper but it is different to experience it in person.</p>
<p>However, while disheartening, those stickers were not the strangest things I saw while walking around. A couple of days ago, I saw a poster for this band called Banda Bassotti. I made little mind of it initially, only noting that for some reason the poster looked like Soviet propaganda. However, looking into it, Banda Bassotti seems to be a very strange example of communist internationalism.</p>
<p>According to some research on Italian wikipedia, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banda_Bassotti">Banda Bassotti</a>, is a Italian Punk, Ska, and Oi! band founded in the 1980s. It seems that they are a political band, focusing on communism and anti-fascism in Italy. This is however, not the strangest thing going on.</p>
<p>Apparently in 2017 and again this year they went on tour, a normal thing for a band to do. However, one of the locations for their tour along with Madrid is the Donbass region. Seemingly part of a anti-fascist caravan to the Donbass, they not only have done musical events in cities in the Donbass, but have delivered aid to the people of the Donbass.</p>
<p>They started doing this in response to the actions the Kiev government took against the separatists of the Donbass region. While the Donbass seperatists are very pro-russians, their take is semi-understandable for one reason.</p>
<p>Considering one of the most famous Ukrainian regiments in the conflict is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion">Azov Battalion</a>, who are known to have neo-nazi sympathies, this fear is understandable. When a regiment runs around with a Wolfsangel and even USA Today lands a <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/03/10/ukraine-azov-brigade-nazis-abuses-separatists/24664937/">interview</a> with them admitting to be Nazis, a rush to fight them is a valid position.</p>
<p>As seen with that, it seems that the political posters and stickers so far compared to D.C are more extreme. When I see in D.C posters advertising to fight with the Peshmerga in a international brigade or something as far-out as that, perhaps some equality will be reached.</p>
