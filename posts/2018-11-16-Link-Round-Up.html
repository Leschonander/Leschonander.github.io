        <pre><code>    &gt; Epistemic status: Hopefully these should prove useful to someone! </code></pre>
<p>As I been learning programing / data science in my spare time for roughly over a year at this point, I at this point have accumulated a lot of links on various technical subjects. This is along with bookmarks on many other topics that I found interesting enough to note for later. Hopefully both the technical and other links should prove interesting. Many are recent things I found, but some are older.</p>
<h3 id="data-science">Data Science</h3>
<p><a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/">Open AI Spinning Up</a>: A educational resource by OpenAI to make it easier to learn deep reinforcement learning, from an introduction and link to papers, to exercises.</p>
<p><a href="https://sgfin.github.io/files/cheatsheets/CS_theory_cheat_sheet.pdf">Theoretical Computer Science Cheat Sheet Definitions Series</a>: A cheat sheet to help out with the theoretical aspects of Computer Science. As machine and deep learning have a lot of advanced math in them a good source to review some math concepts is always helpful. <br> <br> Contains a useful page devoted for calculus, which is always useful if for refreshing memory on calculating derivatives or more complicated things like Hessian or Jacobian Matrices.</p>
<p><a href="https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#lectures">FOUNDATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING</a>: Series of videos and exercises from Bloomberg on machine learning. If one has the spare time I recommend watching the videos as they go heavy in on the math which is good for creating a good theoretical foundation for understanding machine learning.</p>
<p><a href="https://idl.cs.washington.edu/">UW Interactive Data Lab</a>: Website for the University of Washington Interactive Data Lab. Great place to learn about data visualization, from papers and slides from the lab to links to various resources on learning data visualization, such as with D3.js. <br> <br> Also the source of the interesting DSL <a href="https://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/idyll/">Idyll</a> by Matt Conlen. Idyll is a language for creating data driven stories.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84707.Russian_Thinkers">Russian Thinkers by Isaiah Berlin</a>: Excellent collection of essays by Isaiah Berlin, a liberal writer slash philosopher from the 20th century focused on Russia and defending liberalism. One of my favorite essays <em>The Hedgehog and the Fox</em> is contained the book. That essay is a good example of the model based thing some people are chatting about. Also contains one of the few mainstream introductions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_de_Maistre">Joseph de Maistre</a> a semi-obscure counterrevolutionary philosopher. Interesting fact is that Joseph de Maistre is the person behind the phrase <em>Every country has the government it deserves</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fisica.net/mecanicaclassica/struture_and_interpretation_of_classical_mechanics_by_gerald_jay_sussman.pdf">Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</a>: A text styled like SCIP except for learning classical mechanics in physics. Interestingly like the predecessor the code in the book is in Lisp as well. Should be a very useful tool for teaching physics in general, along with being a rather different type of classical mechanics book.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95558.Solaris">Solaris by Stanisław Lem</a>: Stanisław Lem is a Polish Science fiction writer who wrote some amazing and forward thinking sci-fi. Solaris is the first of his books I read and if his other works are like this they are also a strong recommendation.</p>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p><a href="https://verygoods.co/">Very Goods</a>: Website that is the successor of popular startup Svpply along with being founded by Svpplys creator Ben Pieratt. Nice website to browse through various types of apparel and find something distinct.</p>
<p><a href="https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/revolutionary-posters/">Revolutionary Posters by N+1</a>: A article by N+1 on the design group <a href="https://tandem.nyc/">Tandem/</a> who designed the posters for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Good article not only on the world of political campaign graphic design, but on the rise of small companies helping upstart politicians take on the establishment and win. See progressive production company <a href="https://means.media/">Means of Production</a> as another example of this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a>: Notion is a tool that I use to take notes. I personally find it useful because it can work on both a computer and phone. This is along with supporting nice features such as LATEX, code snippets, embedding websites, basic relational databases, Markdown, and a lot more functionality. Really recommend that you use this as a note taking tool.</p>
<p><a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/back-in-the-ussr-meet-the-best-soviet-design-studio-youve-never-heard-of/">Seldom Seen Work by the Best Soviet Design Studio You’ve Never Heard of is Finally Revealed by A Eye on Design</a>: Article on a Soviet Design institute called VNIITE. Good deep dive into the strange world of Soviet design. Closet frame-of-reference in the west perhaps is the aesthetic of a Italian firm called Olivetti.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11170">GenerationMania: Learning to Semantically Choreograph</a>: Using a deep neural network some data scientists created charts for rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution.</p>
