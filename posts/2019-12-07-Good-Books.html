        <p>I have had the opportunity due to disciplined time management for the past year to devote a couple hours a night to some personal reading. While I have read quiet a few books, considering that I had to buy a bookshelf for my apartment for all my books, and it is completely full, it has been a very productive year for reading.</p>
<p>I did not stick to any particular theme, sometimes I read science fiction, sometimes philosophy, other times book computer science books, so it felt like a very healthy mix.</p>
<p>The books are not ordered in any particular order, so there is no ranking involved. They were just books that I generally thought were rather interesting over all. Warning, spoilers for fiction books abound.</p>

<p>I have read quite a few Mishima books this year, from the classics such as <em>Confessions of a Mask</em> to <em>The Temple of the Golden Pavilion</em> to newly translated works such as <em>Star</em>. While I thought all his works were good, I thought <em>The Frolic of the Beasts</em> was particularly good. While many of his books incorporate tragic elements, this book in particular was a very tragic work, as it was a love story gone wrong. This tone manages to be established considering in the first chapter Mishima notes that two of the main characters are dead and another is currently imprisoned, setting the stage for the various tragedies to occur.</p>

<p>At the start of this year, I decided I was going to have a change of pace in regards to the books I read. To start this change of pace, I decided to start reading some Chinese fiction that was translated into English, such as the <em>Three Body Problem</em>. Out of the works of Chinese science fiction that I read, <em>The Waste Tide</em> stuck out to me in particular.</p>
<p>The setting of the plot takes place in a expy of a city known as Guyiu, which is known as the waste capital of the world, as much of the worlds electronic and plastic waste ends up in the city to be recycled.</p>
